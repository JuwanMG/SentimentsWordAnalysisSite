    	Misunderstandings of tone are more than common in a world fueled by communication through text. With an absence of inflection, it is impossible to tell how your email will be taken. Have you ever intended to sound friendly and come off like a jerk? What about wanting to sound stern and come off as indifferent? Without friends and family constantly around to check if the tone in your head matches the tone on paper the way a message sounds is entirely up to your, sometimes incorrect, interpretation. With sentiments, take the mystery out of your tone. Sentiments analyzes your words or phrases and tells you whether the words youâ€™ve used are commonly associated with being negative or positive, and conveniently suggests either more negative or more positive words for you to use. Stop guessing if you sound like a jerk and know you do, with Sentiments.</p>
